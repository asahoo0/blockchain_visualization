# Blockchain_Visualization
The Cryptocurrency Data Visualization project is a web application built using Flask, a Python web framework. The application fetches real-time data from the CoinMarketCap API to display information about the top 10 cryptocurrencies. It provides visual representations of this data through bar charts and pie charts, allowing users to easily understand and compare cryptocurrency prices and market shares.


## Technologies Used:

Flask: The web framework used for building the backend of the application and handling HTTP requests.

CoinMarketCap API: Used to fetch real-time data about cryptocurrencies, including their names, prices, and market shares.

Plotly: A JavaScript graphing library used for creating interactive visualizations, including bar charts and pie charts.

HTML/CSS: Used for structuring the web pages and styling the user interface.
